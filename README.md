# MusicMiner
===================
Final Project for the Advanced Databases Course

Configuration
---------------------------------------
```
The program uses a MongoDB database called 'canciones' and a collection called 'col_name'. The Spotify API is necessary to obtain an access token from the API on the Spotify site for developers
```

Scrapping
---------------------------------------
```
To start mining data simply run the file 'Miner.py' within the same directory as 'Top_Songs_1940_2018.csv'. The process will take approximately 30 minutes.
```

Data processing
---------------------------------------
```
Once you have finished to create the graphs with the valence distribution per year simply run the file SongGrapher.py
```
